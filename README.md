# Path Planning using A* and VFH algorithm.

The objective of this assignment is to autonomously plan and execute a path for a robot in the Stage simulator from a start location to a goal location, given a map. The global plan is given by A* and the local planning is done using a modified Vector Field Histogram (VFH).

 This project was a part of the course CSE:568 Robotics Algorithm.
